# Swenson He

> A sample screen from the Event Building Inc. web application that allows the user to select the task they want. All tasks are categorized under different categories like (Staff, Food, Catering ..etc). As such, the user selects a category and should be able to see all the items under this category. Each item in the category may be included in multiple categories, and other items will only be included in one category.
